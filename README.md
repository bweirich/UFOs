# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a dynamic webpage to allow viewing of the UFO article as well as a table of UFO sightings.  In addition, filters will be added to the table to allow filtering by different criteria desired.

## Results
The webpage is setup to be able to filter the data table of UFO sightings by different desired criteria.  The filters section of the website looks like the below image.

### User Interaction
Sample data was listed in each filter box to allow the user to view the format of each input field.

The user can input the desired information to filter one or multiple columns at one time.  An example of the use of two of the filters, City and Shape, is shown below.

This shows the table filtered by the city of "el cajon" and the shape of "triangle", only showing the table rows that have both criteria.

## Summary
One drawback of this design is that the user does not know the available values available to input into the filters.  For instance, if the user did not know what city values where available they would need to either use trial and error or scroll through the table to view available cities which defeats some of the functionality of the filter.

### Future Improvements
Some future functionality to improve the design would be:
- Allow for the user to sort the data by different columns.  
- Addition of downloading or exporting the table once the desired filters have been applied to allow the user to save their findings.
